# CodeClauseInternship_ChatMates

The Technologies in Action
HTML, CSS, JavaScript :
1. HTML Structure : HTML laid the groundwork, structuring the layout and elements of the messaging interface.
2. CSS Styling : CSS breathed life into the interface, enhancing the aesthetics and usability of ChatMates.
3. JavaScript Functionality : JavaScript added interactivity, handling user actions and facilitating the messaging process.

**WebSockets** :
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets served as the backbone for real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients. Through WebSocket connections, messages were instantly transmitted between users without the need for constant server requests.

Establishing WebSocket Connections: Clients connect to the server using WebSocket connections, enabling seamless communication channels.

Sending and Receiving Messages: Users could type and send messages through the interface, which were transmitted via the WebSocket connection to the server. The server then relayed these messages to the designated recipients in real time.

**Node.js** :
Server-Side Powerhouse: Node.js acted as the server-side runtime environment, enabling the handling of WebSocket connections and facilitating message exchange between users.

**To-Noted** : Site works on website with my node server activated and if ain't working on mobiles or tablets please do find the working of my project on my LinkedIn post : https://rb.gy/4fxg1v
